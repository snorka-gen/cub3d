# Game Engine

This is a game engine project that simulates a 3D environment using collision rendering. It utilizes a map consisting of 0s (representing floors) and 1s (representing walls) to create a maze-like setting. The engine supports sprite rendering and allows the placement of a player character within the maze. The player can navigate the maze, rotate their view, and interact with walls and sprites. Different textures can be applied to the walls to simulate different directions: north, south, west, and east.

## Features

- Collision rendering to simulate a 3D environment
- Maze generation using a map consisting of 0s and 1s
- Sprite rendering and placement within the maze
- Player movement, rotation, and interaction with walls and sprites
- Texturing of walls to simulate different directions (north, south, west, and east)
